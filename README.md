# Custom Portfolio: [BryantCobo.com](https://bryantcobo.com)

This website is a personal portfolio website. It was designed in Figma and coded in Visual Studio Code with React. Aside from needing a portfolio site, this was an opportunity to practice coding in React and experiment with CSS.

## üåü Giving credit where it's due!

Have a look at [Brittany Chiang's portfolio website](https://brittanychiang.com/). Much of her website inspired my site. Specifically, the social media icon component, work experience, and projects sections. Her site is written with Gatsby and is available on her [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bchiang7). I spent a lot of time reviewing her HTML/CSS to recreate in React.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Tools used

- Visual Studio Code: The entire site was written using React. The site has no database or backed services.

- Figma: I used Figma to experiment with color palettes and layouts. [You can view my design in this Figma document](https://www.figma.com/file/ypcPvV09LTa2Pqvsgh9T9G/BryantCobo.com-Design).

## Resources

These are some resources I used to help me create this site:

- I adapted the hamburger menu to React from HTML/CSS/JS using [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flItyHiDm7E) by Miguel Nunez (a.k.a. [Codefoxx](https://github.com/iamcodefoxx)).

- The site uses the [Garet font by Spacetype](https://garet.spacetype.co/). You can download the free font (along with their license) from their website.

- [How to Cleanup Event Listeners in React](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-cleanup-event-listeners-react). This article helped me solve a problem with out of control event listeners on the hamburger menu click and window scroll events.

## Hosting

- I'm hosting this site on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) as a static website. Any update committed to this repository are continuously deployed.
